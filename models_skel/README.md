Rename this folder to `models` and place downloaded ggml models here.

All-MiniLM-L6-v2 model should go exactly to ./models/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/default

GGML models can be stored wherever downloady.py tools puts them for you - just specify full path to the model in .env file.

Use download-model.js to fetch any model with resume download option.
